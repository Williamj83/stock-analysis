## Overview of Project
The project will examine the results of refactoring code for better outcomes. 

### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to determine whether refactoring the code successfully made the VBA script run faster. 
This is done by refactoring code to loop through all the data one time in order to collect the same information. 

## Results
My experience was that the refactored code ran faster.
